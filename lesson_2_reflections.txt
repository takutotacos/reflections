1. when creating a new repository, I could see the message roughly saying that new repository with empty content is created.
this is necessary because you want to make sure that nothing is in the new repository so that you can create your project with no unrelated contents.

2.It is the place you declares that some files need to be watched because it is higly likely that they will move to the repository.
Repository only cares if the files in the staging area are changed.
the working directory has so many files that some of them not necessarily go to repository.
the staging directory tells repository what files go to it
